This is a demo of the file explorer sidebar.

- When you click the file's/folder's icon/name, you can see breadcrumbs above the file explorer.

- When you click a file, the full path to the file is logged in the console.

- When you start typing into the search input, you get files that contain the input string as their name's substring. If you clear the input, you get the tree in the previous state.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
